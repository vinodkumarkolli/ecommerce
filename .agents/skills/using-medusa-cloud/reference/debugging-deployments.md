# Debugging Deployments

## Inspecting Deployments

Status fields per deployment: `backend_status` and `storefront_status`.

Values: `created`, `building`, `built`, `deploying`, `deployed`, `build-failed`, `deployment-failed`, `timed-out` (backend only), `canceled`, `idle`.

```bash
# Most recent failed deployment
mcloud deployments list --json \
  | jq -r '[.[] | select(.backend_status == "build-failed" or .backend_status == "deployment-failed")][0].id'

# Deployments for a specific commit
mcloud deployments list --commit a1b2c3d --json | jq '.'

# Only preview deployments
mcloud deployments list --environment-type preview --json | jq '.'

# Single deployment details
mcloud deployments get bld_01ABC123 --json
```

## Build Failure Recipe

Use when `backend_status == "build-failed"`:

```bash
# Find the most recent build-failed deployment
DEPLOYMENT_ID=$(
  mcloud deployments list --json \
    | jq -r '[.[] | select(.backend_status == "build-failed")][0].id'
)

# Inspect deployment metadata
mcloud deployments get "$DEPLOYMENT_ID" --json

# Read the build output
mcloud deployments build-logs "$DEPLOYMENT_ID"

# For storefront build failures
mcloud deployments build-logs "$DEPLOYMENT_ID" --type storefront
```

`build-logs` returns a `build_status` field. When `failed`, check `metadata.failed_docker_layer` via `mcloud deployments get --json` to identify the failing layer.

## Reproduce a Build Failure Locally

When `build-logs` isn't enough to pinpoint a `build-failed` failure, reproduce the Cloud build locally with `mcloud local build` (mcloud CLI v0.1.10+). It runs the same Docker build Cloud runs, inferring the root path and build variables from the linked project and environment — so you can iterate on a fix without pushing to the tracked branch and waiting for a full Cloud build each time.

> **CRITICAL:** `mcloud local build` requires Docker installed and running, and must run from inside the project's Git repo. It has **no `--json` flag** — it streams plaintext and signals the result through its exit code (`0` = success). Do not parse its output as JSON. It reproduces `build-failed` (build) failures only, not `deployment-failed` (runtime) failures.

Check out the same commit the failed deployment built, then reproduce it so the local build matches:

```bash
DEPLOYMENT_ID=$(
  mcloud deployments list --json \
    | jq -r '[.[] | select(.backend_status == "build-failed")][0].id'
)
COMMIT=$(mcloud deployments get "$DEPLOYMENT_ID" --json | jq -r '.commit_hash')

git checkout "$COMMIT"

if mcloud local build; then
  echo "Build succeeded locally; failure not reproducible from this commit."
else
  echo "Build failed locally; inspect the streamed output for the failing step."
fi

# For a storefront build failure, build the storefront instead
mcloud local build --type storefront
```

If the failure is variable-related, reproduce and test a fix without editing code by overriding variables:

```bash
# Override a single build variable
mcloud local build --var NODE_ENV=production

# Or build against a local .env file
mcloud local build --env-file .env
```

Once the local build exits `0`, push the fix to the tracked branch and start a fresh Cloud build with `mcloud environments trigger-build`.

## Deployment Failure Recipe

Use when `backend_status == "deployment-failed"` (build succeeded, runtime crashed):

```bash
# Find the most recent deployment-failed
DEPLOYMENT_ID=$(
  mcloud deployments list --json \
    | jq -r '[.[] | select(.backend_status == "deployment-failed")][0].id'
)

# Runtime logs for that deployment
mcloud logs --deployment "$DEPLOYMENT_ID" --limit 1000

# Error-level lines only
mcloud logs --deployment "$DEPLOYMENT_ID" --search error --limit 1000

# Filter by HTTP status
mcloud logs --deployment "$DEPLOYMENT_ID" --metadata status=500 --limit 1000

# Structured analysis
mcloud logs --deployment "$DEPLOYMENT_ID" --json | jq '.[] | {timestamp, source, message}'
```

> **Note:** `--follow` cannot be combined with `--json`. Use bounded time windows with `--from`/`--to` and `--json` for scripts.

## Rerunning a Deployment

Two options — not interchangeable:

**Redeploy (environment-side fix):** Re-runs the active deployment's existing build. Use when the fix is a variable change or infra issue.

```bash
mcloud environments redeploy env_123
```

Requires the environment to have an active deployment. If it doesn't, use `trigger-build` first.

**Trigger build (source code fix):** Starts a new build from the tracked branch. Use when the fix is in committed code.

```bash
mcloud environments trigger-build env_123
```

**Verify the new build:**

```bash
mcloud deployments list --environment env_123 --limit 5 --json \
  | jq '.[] | {id, backend_status, commit_hash, updated_at}'
```
